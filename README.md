# NLP Chapter One: Summary and Projects

This repository contains the summarized content and projects from **Chapter 1** of the book "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Hugging Face. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that covers key concepts in NLP using transformer models and demonstrates their usage with Hugging Face tools.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that summarizes the first chapter, including key concepts, examples, and applications of transformers in NLP.
- `img/`: A folder containing images that support the explanations and visualizations in the notebook.


### Prerequisites

The notebook already includes all necessary libraries and installation steps. You can simply execute the code and install the dependencies 

# Running the Notebook
The notebook contains the code needed to install required libraries and run the examples. Just follow the instructions in the notebook itself to get started.

# Technologies Used
- Hugging Face Transformers: A popular library for working with state-of-the-art transformer models.



# Challenges & Next Steps
This project introduces the fundamental concepts of transformers for NLP tasks. In future chapters, we will explore more complex models and tackle specific challenges such as fine-tuning, multilingual models, and working with large datasets.
